# Rx_simple_example
In this example, you will find a parent model called MyEvent with two inherited children models MyEvent1 and MyEvent2. 
those events are created to show that we can emit different events of the same base to the observable. 
any observer can subscribe to the observable then apply any action based on the type of that model.
